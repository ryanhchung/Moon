I have been enjoying various sports. I trained in football, badminton, boxing, and thai boxing. Especially, I have been training in brazilian jiu-jitsu since early 2018. I also trained a little bit of wrestling and judo, which creates synergy when trained with jiu-jitsu.

Furthermore, I have been into weight training for the past five years. Recently, my big three 1RM almost reached 1000lbs.
