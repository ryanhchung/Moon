## All research projects

### Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC) 
* Participatied in research about the role of Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and macrophages on the metastasis of mammary gland breast cancer in phosphorylated-elf4E deficient mice samples

### Milner Therapeutics Institute & Veraverse
* Participated in research about Stem-like subtype of gastric cancer - Especially investigated the characteristics of Stem-like gastric cancer derived metastasis

### Asan Center for Cancer Genome Discovery In Collaboration with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (ASAN-CCGD)
* Investigated the genetic lineage between cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal tissue resident fibroblasts from pan-cancer genomics data
* Investigated the putative biomarkers for HCC, predicted immunotherapy response in HCC patients by machine learning
* Participated in research to identify specific lung cancer organoids and corresponding primary tissues for developing new immunotherapy
